Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a revised version of your README content for the "Emotional-Intelligent-Analyzer" project:

Emotional-Intelligent-Analyzer
# Introduction
With the increasing reliance on online interactions, understanding computer behavior and human emotions has become more critical, especially post-pandemic. To address this, we explore the automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, primarily using geometric and appearance-based methods.

# Project Overview
Facial Expression Recognition involves four key stages:

Pre-processing
Face Detection
Feature Extraction
Expression Classification
In this project, we apply various deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to identify seven primary human emotions:

Anger
Disgust
Fear
Happiness
Sadness
Surprise
Neutrality
# Motivation
The advancement of modern technology has fueled our aspirations, leading to significant research in digital imaging and image processing. The growth in this field has been exponential, and its applications are extensive.

# Conclusion
Our project aims to contribute to this expanding field by providing a robust solution for automatic emotion detection using deep learning methods.
